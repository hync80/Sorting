# Sorting #Insertion Sorting
Sorting is a process or an algorithm by which we arrange data's into ascending or descending order. In this we will take input by the user and push elements in an array and then the program will sort it 
Here the Program is written in the coding language C
Let's understand this by the help of a practical example...
suppose a person requested for a cab ride in an app , and 6 cab drivers connect himself with him let them named as C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6 and they are 6,3,5,8,…. minutes away from the passenger respectively . Suppose C2 accepts the request first , at that time there will form a array and it contain the “time away from the passenger” and element in the array will 3 after some time C1 accepts the request then array will extend and contain two elements 3,6 after some time 3rd will accept then again array will expand …..like this as time passes different cab driver will accept the request and the array size increases. as most of the people will chose cab driver who is less minutes away then here we need to arrange the data in a sorted(ascending) order so that person can chose easily the best availability for him....
so we can say as the data provided overtime not at initially then we use insertion sorting
